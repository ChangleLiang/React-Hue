React Hue ia a color palette tool built in a combination of Meteor.js, React, Material UI, Bootstrap. This simple web app mainly to contribute to seek what are better colors for web, mobile, UI development, the popular color set used by industry companies, the popular color rank in Dribbble, color toolboxs, and some information for color blindness.

###Version 1.0

##Why use Meteor?
Real-time, easy-use.

##Why use React?
React is fast rendered, and enforces a lot of rules and guidelines that make it clearer what the “right” way to do any given task is. While it’s not as tightly integrated with Meteor (yet), it does have a much larger overall ecosystem, and also supports a couple extra key features that Blaze doesn’t


##Why use Material UI?
I am always a fan of Twitter Bootstrap since I started to learn web techniques. However, I got a little bored after I built several demos websites based on the same style framework. Finally, I find Material UI is really clear, attractive, delightful. Meanwhile, I just learned a few things about React, and it is a good time to try new taste, combined with the good side of Bootstrap. After all, we should try new tools.
